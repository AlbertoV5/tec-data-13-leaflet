* Mapping Earthquake Data

** Objective

Our task was to create a visualization of recent earthquakes around the world. We fit together multiple pieces of knowledge and resources, including APIs, data visualization with JavaScript and GeoJSON. The result was an interactive map with multiple layers and overlays.

** Results

Our map contains 3 overlays with different data to show and 3 layers for different backgrounds.

In this first example we can see the streets layer with all 3 ovelays active.

For example we can move into the east and change the background to dark and show only tectonic plates and major earthquakes.

Finally we can take a look at the satellite layout with only the tectonic plates overlay.

** Conclusion

This project helped us get an understanding of many tools that can relate to GeoMapping or not, for example all the functional and object oriented parts of JavaScript were used in one or other way and we were able to use asynchronous behaviour when doing JSON requests. In the end it is all focused in GeoMapping functionality but many of the procedures are useful for any other applications.
